Philippe presents an idea to the block-chain garage community.

- The goal : let's create a crypto-currency for digityser.

  - Not a financial asset.
  - Asset back crypto.
  - Public/private blockchain
  

- Use cases : 
    - Pay your beers with crypto-currency
    - A coin to facilitate collaboration between people. Service area. Motivate people.
    - 
    
 
- Jean has already produced a coin with an online tool : http://tokenfactory.netlify.com/#/factory 
  - name : DigitYserCoinTest2
  - total supply : 100 
  - 

- Demonstration : sending money between 2 accounts : CIPHER mobile wallet and metamask. On Ethereum plateforme, you need to pay gas for each transaction.


- Tokenization : example of diamond.

- Fongible : one unit is = to another.
- Non fongible : like crypto kitties.

- How do you calculate the profit?
 => for the first stage of the experiment, the coin on the blockchain is no different as cash in the bar cash box.

- Note : invite muntuit to come and talk about. LE

- Etherscan
- ETH Gas Station

-Other idea : tokenizing concert tickets 
  -How can you make people download the tools they need to exchange the currency.
  -How can people buy easily
